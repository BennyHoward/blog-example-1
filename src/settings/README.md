# Settings Module

This module is similar to the [NestJS Config](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration) module, but unlike the NestJS Config module, the setting module is intended for to be used to manage mutable configurations, because the NestJS Config module stores settings in an immutable way.  

This is useful because it will enable the application to be re-configured while running and with no downtime.
