# Architectural Explanation

This is a brief discussion on how this demo application was architected and why certain decisions was made.  

This project was created using the [Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/) framework with the following command:  

```sh
nest new 'blog-example-1' --skip-git --skip-install --package-manager npm --language TS
```

## Backend Tech Stack

An [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) based framework called [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/)

**TODO**

## Frontend Tech Stack

Languages:

- HTML and the Handlebars template engine via the backend (`.hbs`)
- TypeScript and TypeScript with XML (`.ts` and `.tsx`)
  [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) is a super set of the JavaScript language.  The type safety it provides does a really good job of preventing many classes of bugs, especially `TypeError`s and `ReferenceError`s caused by `undefined` and `null`.  
- SCSS (`.scss`)

Frameworks:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- 

**TODO**

## Deployment Tech Stack

- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) (and Docker Compose)
